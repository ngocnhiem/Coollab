Contributing can be as easy as [<b style={{color: "#F4AD7F"}}>taking the time to report a bug</b>](/Contribute/Feedback) or [<b style={{color: "#8656D7"}}>telling your friends about Coollab</b>](/Contribute/Outreach), and it doesn't necessarily require any coding skills, there are also a lot of <b>[design](/Contribute/Design)</b> and <b>[communication](/Contribute/Outreach)</b> jobs to be done!

Also, feel free to create a post on [Discord](https://discord.gg/p8DGTZQnmW) or an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Coollab-Art/Coollab/issues) to discuss / ask how you could contribute!
