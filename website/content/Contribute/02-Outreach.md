## Make tutorials
</span>

Videos are cool, but you can also write a text-based tutorial if you prefer that! Or maybe make *Quick Tip* videos of about 1 minute? Feel free to [share them in the Discord](https://discord.gg/Y4KHAZEwMt), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/Coollab-Art/Coollab/issues/new), or via [email](mailto:coollab.lib@gmail.com).

## Organize workshops

Please feel free to invite me, I love to give workshops to teach Coollab! This is always so nice to have an opportunity to travel and meet new people! ✨<Spacer height="8px"/>
Or if you know of a space around Paris that would be willing to host some form of a regular meetup, that would be amazing!<Spacer height="8px"/>
