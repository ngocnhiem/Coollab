## Make a donation

Even 1€ goes a long way and is very heartwarming 💖 In an ideal world down the line I would receive enough donations to make a living out of Coollab and be able to work full time on it!<Spacer height="8px"/>
In the meantime this money helps pay the interns that I take on each summer!<Spacer height="8px"/>
We are on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Coollab) and [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Coollab-Art)
