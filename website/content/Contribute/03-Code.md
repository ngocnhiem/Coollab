## Write GLSL Shaders

It is very easy to create your own nodes, just by writing a few lines of glsl: [here is the complete tutorial](/Tutorials/Writing%20Nodes/Intro).<Spacer height="8px"/>
You can share your nodes with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/p8DGTZQnmW) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/Coollab-Art/Coollab/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=add-node.yaml&title=%5BNew+node%5D+), and we might add them to Coollab if it makes sense and if you are okay with that!<Spacer height="8px"/>
[Here is a list of effects](https://github.com/orgs/Coollab-Art/projects/1/views/31) that we would like to add to Coollab at some point. Maybe you can make one of them? 😁 Otherwise feel free to make your own!

## Contribute to the C++ codebase
</span>

You can have a look at the [good first issues](https://github.com/Coollab-Art/Coollab/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), and feel free to comment on the issues to ask for more details and help to get started.<Spacer height="8px"/>
You can also start working on your own feature that you want to see added to Coollab, but please discuss it with us before, to make sure we might be interested in merging it into Coollab. On [Discord](https://discord.gg/p8DGTZQnmW) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/Coollab-Art/Coollab/issues).<Spacer height="8px"/>
And before you start coding, make sure to read the [**getting started**](https://github.com/Coollab-Art/Coollab/tree/main/docs/Dev) section of the doc! Coollab is pretty easy to setup and compile, and the doc will guide you through all of it!
