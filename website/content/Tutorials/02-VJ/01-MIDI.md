To control something with a MIDI controller:
- Plug a MIDI node into the pin of whichever parameter you want to control:

Then, you need to select which fader you want to use:
- Select your MIDI node
- In the Inspector click on the <span class="icon-cog"></span> button to open the MIDI Config window

- On your MIDI controller, move the fader that you want to use and you will see one of the bars changing:

- Hover that bar and you will see the Index of the fader
- Go back to your MIDI node and set this Index value
